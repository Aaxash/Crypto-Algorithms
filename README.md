## Implementing Atbash Cipher
Atbash cipher is a substitution cipher with just one specific key where all the letters are reversed that is A to Z and Z to A. ### The following key is used in the Atbash algorithm
- ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
- ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA



## Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”

### Example
- Text : ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
- Shift: 23
- Cipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW

- Text : ATTACKATONCE
- Shift: 4
- Cipher: EXXEGOEXSRGI

### Mono-Alphabetic Substitution Cipher
A mono-alphabetic cipher (aka simple substitution cipher) is a substitution cipher where each letter of the plain text is replaced with another letter of the alphabet. It uses a fixed key which consist of the 26 letters of a “shuffled alphabet”.

### Poly-Alphabetic Substitution Cipher
A poly-alphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using several substitution alphabets. In polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, the plaintext letters are enciphered differently based upon their installation in the text. Rather than being a one-to-one correspondence, there is a one-to-many relationship between each letter and its substitutes.
